	<h3>User Interviews</h3>
	User interviews were used to examine the user experience and thoughts of portfolio websites. In particular, I sought understanding of the user's use of technology, objectives, and problems when interacting with a portoflio website.

	<h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
	Competitor analysis examines and evaluates competitors and their strategies to determine their strengths and weaknesses in comparison to your own. I targeted portfolios of software developers that represent the other job applicants who compete with me for an employment position.

	<h3>Feature Value Matrix</h3>
	A feature value matrix analyzes the potential features of a product in regards to how much value it yields for the user and the business while taking into account the difficulty or effort needed to implement the feature. The features I considered for this portoflio website came from what I personally believed would be valuable and also what was derived from the user interviews. These features were something users would expect or like to have and also were possible solutions to their pain points.

	<h3>Feature Prioritization</h3>
	The afforementioned feature value matrix was extremely useful in determining features that brought great value to the user and business while not costing too much effort. By building these good value features into the interface, it helped ensure the product was useful rather than being feature deprived or lacking useful features.

	<h3>User Stories</h3>
	User stories attempt to capture a description of a feature from the end-user's perspective, allowing you to consider many different use cases even for the same feature. Creating the user stories for this portfolio website led me to consider what each possible user's goals were and the ways they interacted with the website.

	<h3>Cognitive  Walkthrough</h3>
	The cognitive walkthroughs examines the usability for a interface and design with participants first hand in the hopes of uncovering interaction problems. Designing the sets of tasks and questions to not be too vague yet not too specific can be challenging in itself when trying to extract accurate and meaningful information.

	<h3>User Testing</h3>
	One of the user tests I conducted attempted to examined the first impressions of my website given a 5 second screenshot. Knowing that potential visitors may have little patience, I wanted to make sure the portfolio was at least not turning visitors away at the first impression. The other test was a click test that showed me a heatmap of where a person would click to view my resume. I used this click test to confirm whether the resume-icon-button was actually useful or people were deferring to clicking the "Resume" link in the navigation bar.

	<h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
	<hr>
	<pre>	One of the most important insights I discovered from user testing is that it is hard to make assumptions about users and their interactions, or at least accurate assumptions. It turned out that, since I was the creator of the website, I had very inaccurate ideas about how a new or infrequent user may interact with my portfolio. It was difficult for me to correctly imagine what a new user's attention was drawn to, what pre-existing knowledge a user may have, etc.
	
	While cognitive walkthroughs took much more time and effort to conduct, they yielded much more quality information than the usability tests. I was more able to view where a user's attention was attracted to and whether certain features were correctly being noticed and used. Ultimately, in my pursuit of using less words and more icons, I seemed to have lost some effectiveness in communicating the content and features of the website.

	<h2>Incorporation of Findings</h2>
	<hr>
	<pre>	My first priority in adjusting the portfolio website was to adjust my understanding of my users, particularly new users. I should not expect that the users will recognize and know every what each icon is or that they are even clickable. For example, it was a hit or a miss whether a user may hover over an icon they were not familiar with in order to see the pop out text. My general solution will be to add text labels or some words to provide textual context such as "Resume Preview:".
	
	One of the major challenges is be to determine a balance between listening and incorporating each feedback into the website and analyzing pain points and difficulties but not act on them individually. For instance, I received a lot of feedback about the matcha green tea background. A shallow response to this criticism would be to change the background to a more likeable color like blue for instance. However, it is important to examine the cause of a problem and not focus on the symptoms. It is possible that the over use of the color rather than the color itself is the problem. Therefore, I opted to make the background color more transparent that not only decreased the visual impact of the green color but also allowed the other colors such as the font colors to come through.
